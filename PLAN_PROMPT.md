# Implementation Plan Guidelines

Create an implementation plan in `plan.md`.

The initial phase(s) of the project should focus on a vertical slice of the application, allowing for end-to-end testing of the architecture. This means implementing a minimal set of features across all layers of the stack, rather than completing each layer in isolation.

Do not write tests in this plan. Tests will be added later in the project.
